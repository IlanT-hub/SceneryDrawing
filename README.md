# SceneryDrawing
Description:
Scenery Drawing is a visual Java application utilizing Java Swing and AWT to render detailed graphics. It demonstrates custom drawing techniques to illustrate scenic elements such as sky, ground, trees, clouds, birds, and a bright sun.

How It Works:

Overrides the paintComponent method to draw directly onto a JPanel.
Draws geometric shapes and utilizes colors strategically to compose a natural landscape scene.
Incorporates helper methods (drawCloud, drawBird) to modularize code.
My Process:

Drafted a rough sketch of the scenery design to identify required shapes and components.
Methodically implemented each graphic component in Java Swing using drawing primitives.
Refined graphical elements, tested different color combinations, and optimized rendering performance.

Technologies Used:

Java, Swing, AWT.
